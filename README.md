## What does this app do?

A simple app that takes the users current geolocation and the current month of the year and renders to the screen the following options:

### Lets hit the beach!

Displays if it currently summer for the user

### Burr, it's cold

Displays if it currently winter for the user

## This app doesn't do much does it?

No, it doesn't, nor is it really useful. This app was made during early learning of the react framework and serves no real purpose other than to tell the user something they should already know

## Why do you need my location?

Your location is needed to determine wether it is currently summer or winter where you are.
